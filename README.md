This plugin is in it's very initial steps and there are many ideas, some of those will be listed bellow
Users are encouraged to add their own custom features via the public [API](#api).

Development is focused on:

* Performance
* Making fix commands for auto fix

### Actions

Custom actions may be mapped which can invoke API or perform your own actions.
